          Magic: The Gathering (colloquially known as Magic or just MTG) is a
          collectible and digital collectible card game created by Richard
          Garfield. Released in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast (now a subsidiary
          of Hasbro), Magic was the first trading card game and has
          approximately thirty-five million players as of December 2018, and
          over twenty billion Magic cards produced in the period from 2008 to
          2016, during which time it grew in popularity. <br /><img

            alt=""
          /><br />Each game of Magic represents a battle between Planeswalkers
          (each human player is a Planeswalker) who cast spells, use artifacts,
          and summon creatures as depicted on individual cards in order to
          defeat their opponents, typically, but not always, by draining them of
          their starting life total. Although the original concept of the game
          drew heavily from the motifs of traditional fantasy role-playing games
          such as Dungeons & Dragons, the gameplay bears little similarity to
          pencil-and-paper adventure games, while simultaneously having
          substantially more cards and more complex rules than many other card
          games. <br /><img

            alt=""
          /><br />
          Magic can be played by two or more players, either in person with
          printed cards or on a computer, smartphone or tablet with virtual
          cards through the Internet-based software Magic: The Gathering Online
          or other video games such as Magic: The Gathering Arena. It can be
          played in various rule formats, which fall into two categories:
          constructed and limited. Limited formats involve players building a
          deck spontaneously out of a pool of random cards with a minimum deck
          size of 40 cards; in constructed formats, players create decks from
          cards they own, usually with a minimum of 60 cards per deck.

            alt=""
          /><br />

          New cards are released on a regular basis through expansion sets. An
          organized tournament system (the DCI) played at the international
          level and a worldwide community of professional Magic players has
          developed, as well as a substantial resale market for Magic cards.
          Certain cards can be valuable due to their rarity in production and
          utility in gameplay, with prices ranging from a few cents to thousands
          of dollars.
