# Magic-the-gathering
This is my project using API from Magic The Gathering. Its still in progress


So in this project for the first time ever I use API to build things, and I really love it. I decided to use Magic The Gathering API and I made fully working APP where you can search by 
set and filter cards by rarity. App looks amazing, and it has everything that you need to work with cards. I can choose favorite cards and move them in container, I can click card to see
more information about it, I also can remove cards from favorites if I want to.

I made an app in HTML, CSS and JavaScript 2 and a half months after I started to learn programming. I still want to start to learn backend, so more users can use it to look up the cards
and use favorite cards. I also plan to add options, so the user can create card sets, and to search card by name, witch I didn't do now, because UI would too cluttered. I manage those things 
later, when I learn enough backend, so I can make it fully working for other people, so they can make ACC and then do all things with cards that they want to do.

Building this app was a great experience. For the first time I saw how much you can do with JavaScript and I really loved it.
